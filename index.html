        <!-- description about me -->
        <p>
            My name is Roya Jamshidpour and I am a creative and skilled web developer with a background in being a successful self-employed musician 
            as well as a member of the hardworking service industry. Having been self-employed allows leveraging of extensive experience in self-promotion, 
            communication with clients and team-members, as well as always producing a product that is of quality and is uniquely appealing. I am an organized 
            and detail-oriented coder who has contributed greatly to past projects by finding ways to write code more efficiently. For example, my last project 
            was an app that curated an evening-in for the user. It called data from multiple APIs based on user search input. In a team of four, I was
             responsible for the front- end development with an emphasis on the UI. I helped classmates identify bugs in their code and was consistently 
             approached by project teammates to double-check their work. I recently earned a certificate in web development at the prestigious Northwestern 
             University and have a fresh perspective on building dynamic and responsive applications. Is passionate about making apps with a unique, yet user-friendly 
             flow that are effective while also being aesthetically interesting and clean. Strengths lay in team-driven collaboration as well as bringing a creative, 
             problem-solving eye to any project.
